<h4> Is Covishield risky?</h4>
<p>The Claims Various social media posts have blamed the Indian government for permitting Covishield, alleging it puts people at risk of TTS. However, a fact-check by The Healthy Indian Project (THIP) reveals that while there is a risk of TTS, it’s exceptionally rare.
</p>
<h4>What's TTS?</h4> 
<p>Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) is a serious condition characterized by low platelet count and blood clot formation. Symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain, headaches, and easy bruising. AstraZeneca has acknowledged a rare link between its vaccine and TTS.</p>

<h4>What is the rare side effect of AstraZeneca?</h4>
<p>Recent revelations regarding a potential rare side effect of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield, have sparked concerns among the public. A legal submission by AstraZeneca admitted that their vaccine could lead to Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS), a condition characterised by blood clot formation and low platelet count. The claim is only partially accurate as per the fact check by The Healthy Indian Project (THIP). However, it's important to understand the actual risk associated with this side effect.</p>

<h4>​How much is the risk of developing TTS?</h4>
<p>Following the initial dosage of Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca), the estimated risk of developing TTS was 2.6 per 100,000 individuals, with more severe results observed in those under 60 years of age. There was a significantly decreased chance of experiencing TTS after the second dose, as per the Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre.</p>
<h4>​Should you be concerned if you are vaccinated with Covishield?</h4>
<p>No. As of now, there is no reason to panic. Dr Jayadevan, Co-Chairman of the National Indian Medical Association (IMA) Covid Task Force in Kerala, told ANI that TTS is a rare occurrence following specific types of vaccines and other causes. Most cases of TTS are reported within a few weeks of vaccination. Therefore, staying vigilant and consulting a doctor if you experience any symptoms of TTS is advisable.


AstraZeneca developed the COVID-19 vaccine in collaboration with Oxford University. Both vaccines are identical in formulation but are manufactured and distributed in different geographical locations. AstraZeneca's vaccine is categorised as an adenovirus vector vaccine and has shown 60–80% protection against COVID-19 infection in clinical trials.

It is also to be noted that TTS is linked to other COVID-19 vaccines as well. Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine, named Janssen, has also been associated with this condition. According to a 2023 report by Yale Medicine haematologist Robert Bona, MD, TTS typically occurs in individuals who are bedridden, hospitalised or have other medical issues related to inflammation, infection, or cancer</p>
